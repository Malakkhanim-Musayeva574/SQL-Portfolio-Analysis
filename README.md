# SQL-Portfolio-Analysis
Project overview:
This project is a deep dive into an HR database to extract meaningful business insights.
I used advanced SQL techniques to analyze employee distribution, salary structures, and management performance.
My goal was to move beyond simple queries and handle complex data relationships.
Techniques Used:
Complex Joins: Connecting multiple tables to create unified reports.
Subqueries: Used to identify specific data points, such as finding the top earner within each individual department.
Window Functions: Applied DENSE_RANK() to rank departments by their average salary performance.
Data Aggregation: Extensive use of GROUP BY with COUNT(), AVG(), MAX(), and MIN() for statistical summaries.
Managerial Analysis: Self-joins to calculate the number of reports per manager and their team's average salary.
Key Business Insights=Headcount Leader: The Shipping department is the largest unit in the company with 45 employees.
Screenshots/: Visual evidence of the SQL queries and their results.
Presentation.pptx: A final summary of the findings for non-technical stakeholders.
